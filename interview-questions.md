# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function works like a machine that contains code to perform a desired outcome

  Researched answer: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it). You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.



2. What is the difference between (A) map and (B)filter?

  Your answer: Both map and filter are built-in methods within a function that differ in how they operate. map is a short-cut for functions that are processing multiple arguments while filter acts as a conditional statement that filters the desired outcome in a function.

  Researched answer:
  (A) The .map() function iterates through an array and returns a new array of the same length.
  (B) The .filter() function loops through an array and returns a new array with only the values that are truthy or the values that satisfy your stated condition. Filter will return a subset of the given array.



3. What is the difference between map/filter and a for loop?

  Your answer:for loop iterates a block of code, while both map and filter are capable of performing the same function as a loop, both differ from each other as noted in the previous question. The difference I can draw from a for loop and map/filter is syntax and length of code.

  Researched answer: The for statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the condition is true. It will only stop when the condition becomes false. "But the big difference is that the conditions for iteration are handled for us by map/filter. We’re guaranteed to get every element of the array in the right order. We don’t have to manage our own index variable or condition for that variable. Map also provides the benefit of immutability. When we run map, it creates a new array and leaves our original array alone



4. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() is for front-end code that'll render on the console. Return is back-end code that calls the desired outcome. You'll find return in functions.There can only be one return that runs in a function where as the console log can have many.

  Researched answer: "console.log is a function that logs the arguments you pass to the web console. return is a statement which specifies the value returned from a function."



5. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is a statement that is being tested inside of the function.
  "Outside information that the function needs in order toproperly." - Rachael

  Researched answer: "An argument of a function is a value that must be provided to obtain the function's result."



6. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming requires two developers to assume a role, either a "driver" or "navigator". These roles must interchange to share the work load and insure an equal exchange of information, perspective, and peer editing. The driver role requires the developer to input code, whereas the navigator essentially navigates the process of coding for a desired outcome.   

  Researched answer:Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Challenges and stretch challenges after a lesson is really helpful for application reasons. I also find the games played after lunch to be really helpful in building team morale while offering a delightful break from all the information absorbed.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase
- Class inheritance:Classes are the blueprint for objects. Classes are reusable and customizable, much like functions. Classes can inherit information from other classes creating a parent-child relationship. Class inheritance keeps code from being repetitive
- React: React is used to build webpages, mobile web pages, and even native mobile applications.
- Yarn: $ yarn create react-app app-name
- React State: React state is an object managed within a component
- this: this is a component of the state object
